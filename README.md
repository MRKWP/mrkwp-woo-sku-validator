# WooCommerce SKU Validator Plugin
WooCommerce SKU Validator Plugin is an Admin Page to show all invalid SKU values inside your WooCommerce Product data.

It is a great tool to validate SKU data before it is pushed to the Merchant Centre in Google.

There is a blog article on my website on how to validate an SKU that covers how this plugin works.
